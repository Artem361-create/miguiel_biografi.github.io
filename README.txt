I help brokers, OTC desks, exchanges, and payment providers scale their digital asset operations by delivering institutional-grade infrastructure, OTC liquidity and white-label trading platform from Finery Markets.

With 16 years of experience in sales and marketing, including leadership roles at Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Allianz, I bring a strong TradFi foundation into the crypto space. Prior to joining Finery Markets, I successfully led the growth of retail broker sales at a major bank in the CIS region.

My blend of traditional finance expertise and deep understanding of crypto infrastructure makes me a valuable partner for firms looking to launch or expand their digital asset offering.
